You must have python installed to run abspath.
Copy abspath where you want - somewhere in your PATH - and make sure it is
executable:

  chmod a+x abspath
  
Building the man page requires docbook and xmlto:

  asciidoc -b docbook -d manpage abspath.1.txt
  xmlto man abspath.1.xml
  perl -e 's/\.sp$/\n\.sp/g' -pi abspath.1
  
And that's all.
